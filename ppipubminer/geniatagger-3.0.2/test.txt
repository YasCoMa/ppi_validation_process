Human transcription initiation factor TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding polypeptide (TBP) and at least 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that collectively or individually are involved in activator-dependent transcription.
To investigate protein-protein interactions involved in TFIID assembly and in TAF-mediated activator functions, we have cloned and expressed cDNAs encoding human TAFII80 and TAFII31.
Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that TAFII80 interacted with TAFII250, TAFII31, TAFII20, and TBP, but not with TAFII55.
Similar assays showed that TAFII80 interacted with TFIIE alpha and with TFIIF alpha (RAP74) but not with TFIIB, TFIIE beta, or TFIIF beta (RAP30).
Further studies with TAFII80 mutations revealed three distinct interaction domains which fall within regions conserved in human TAFII80, Drosophila TAFII60, and yeast TAFII60.
The N terminus of TAFII80 (residues 1-100) interacts with both TAFII31 and TAFII20, while two C-terminal regions are involved, respectively, in interactions with TAFII250 and TFIIF alpha (RAP74) (residues 203-276) and with TBP and TFIIE alpha (residues 377-505).
The interactions between TAFII80 and general factors TFIIE alpha and TFIIF alpha (RAP74) could be important for recruitment of GTFs during activator-dependent transcription.
Because TAFs 80, 31, and 20 show sequence similarities to histones H4, H3, and H2B, as well as some parallel interactions, this subset of TAFs may form a related core structure within TFIID.
